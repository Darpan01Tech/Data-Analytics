# Google Play Store Data-Analytics

📌 **Overview**
This project analyzes data from the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights about app categories, user ratings, installs, reviews, and pricing trends.
The analysis was performed using Python (Colab) for data cleaning and visualization, followed by Power BI for building an interactive dashboard.

🚀 **Features**

-Cleaned and preprocessed raw Google Play Store data
-Analyzed app ratings, installs, and category distributions
-Visualized Free vs Paid apps and their performance
-Created an interactive Power BI dashboard showing top app categories, average ratings, and installs

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Kaggle Datasets API
Google Colab
Power BI

📊 **Example Workflow**
-Data loading, cleaning, and visualization using Python
-Power BI dashboard creation for visual storytelling:
  -Top 10 App Categories by Count
  -Free vs Paid App Distribution
  -Average Rating by Category
  -KPI Cards showing average installs, reviews, rating, and price.

🔮 **Future Improvements**
-Add more KPI metrics such as app size impact on rating
